### Test Driven Programming with Bob the Lackadaisical Teenager
This assignment is my foray into test driven programming. There is a test suite (bob_test) against which I developed the executable code (bob). Depending on the type of remark given to Bob (question, exclamation, nothing or nothing tangible, and everything else), he provides one of four responses.

Methods in bob are defined to accept the single remark argument, then calculate and return true/false in the if statement of the hey method.
